Loosen the 2 screws. Remove the fan.
5.3.5 To remove the air filter
CAUTION: Be careful when the air filter is
removed. Dust particles must not fall down in
the carburetor inlet. Removal of waste is best
done with a vacuum cleaner.
1.
Remove the 3 screws and remove the cover.
2.
Remove the 2 screws and remove the air filter
holder and the air filter.

Attach the screw press in the center.
7.
Lock the outer socket with a wrench and tighten the
center screw until the flywheel releases.
Note: If the flywheel is not easy to remove, hit the
center screw with a hammer. At the same time, lift
the product with the handle of the flywheel puller.
6.3.2 To examine the seat and key
The key in the flywheel can not be replaced. If the key is
damaged the flywheel must be replaced. For a correct
ignition point, the position of the flywheel must align with
the position of the crankshaft. The force of the center nut
is not sufficient to hold the flywheel in the right position.
6.3.3 To assemble the flywheel
The crankshaft and the center of the flywheel must be
free from grease. Tightening torque 18–22 lbf·ft /25–30
Nm. Use a torque wrench to tighten the nut.
1.
Align the key in the flywheel with the keyway on the
crankshaft. Install the washer and nut.
2.
Remove the tool and put the springs on the start
hooks.
6.4 Air filter
6.4.1 Function
The centrifugal cleaning is the first step in the air
cleaning of the inlet air. The blades on the flywheel
supply the cylinder with cool air. This is shown with large
arrows in the illustration. The blades are also the part in
operation on the centrifugal cleaning of the inlet air of
the engine. An inlet tube is installed near the blades on
the flywheel. The centrifugal force prevents large
particles to follow the air to the inlet tube. They are
moved out, past the tube. Only small dust particles
follow the air to the inlet.
6.4.2 To replace the air filter
CAUTION: Be careful when the air filter is
removed. Dust particles must not fall down in
the carburetor inlet. Removal of waste is best
done with a vacuum cleaner.

"
36,Dust,"CAUTION: Make sure that the inlet pipes are
not damaged and that they have a tight seal to
the air filter and the carburetor. Dust in the inlet
pipes is a sign of dangerous faults in the filter
system. They must be repaired before operating
this product.
1.
To remove the air filter, see To remove the air filter
on page 20.
2.
When you replace the air filter, examine and clean
the inlet tube.
3.
Remove dust from dry cutting with compressed air.
Remove material from wet cutting mechanically.
4.
Make sure that the rubber seal on the air duct cover
is not damaged and that it is correctly attached in
the cylinder cover.
5.
Replace the service filter if it is damaged.
6.
Do not clean the paper filter. Replace it when the
power of the product starts to decrease.

40,Dust,"6.6.2 To disassemble the guides
1.
Remove the support insert.
2.
Push out an edge of the guides, then push them out
by hand.
6.6.3 To examine the inlet system
Dust can decrease the life of the engine. Dust on the
inner side of the seals means there is defective or
incorrectly installed components.
1.
Look for leaks. Make sure the rubber guides are not
cracked.
6.6.4 To assemble the inlet manifolds
The parts must be installed correctly. Make a note that
the guide to the inlet is irregular.
Make a note of the groove on the holder.

Repair and servicing - 37
"
52,Dust,"6.9 Piston wear
The cause of engine failure can be hard to find if the
previous operation and service of the product is not
available. Use the following examples for help.
6.9.1 Usual wear
Usual wear is easiest to see on the piston sections that
point at the exhaust and inlet sides. The picture shows
that the piston has been polished to give a bright
surface. The lines from the production can also be seen.
Oil on the piston rings shows correct lubrication. The
piston rings can move freely in the piston ring groove.
6.9.2 Dust
If dust enters the engine, the engine life decreases. The
effect of dust can be seen with a magnifying glass.
Rounded lines in line with the travel of the piston are
clear signs. The lines after production cannot be seen.
The surface is matt.
The usual cause is a bad filter and/or leakage. Examine
the condition of the filters and gaskets. Also examine the
rubber guides between the cylinder, the carburetor and
the connections. Look for dust from the filter units to the
inlet by the cylinder. Carbon particles on the top of the
piston show that the product is used at short intervals.
The engine has not become fully warm.
6.9.3 Scoring
Scoring occurs when the engine is too hot. The scores
are usually on the exhaust side, which is the hottest.
The inlet side can show equivalent damage.
Examine the product to see if it has broken down
because of an incorrect oil mixture, or no oil at all. If
there is oil on a piston that is too hot it can carbonize. If
not, check if the connecting rod or the crankcase has a
thin layer of oil.
If there is sufficient oil, inlet leakage can be the cause.
When the engine leaks air on the inlet side, the fuel/air
mixture changes. This causes scoring, mainly on the
exhaust side. Look for scoring damage in combination
with a piston top that has become too hot.
6.9.4 Too hot piston top
If the engine has been too hot, aluminum particles are
frequently found on the top of the piston. This can cause
the piston to melt.
Too much air in relation to the fuel volume increases the
temperature in the combustion chamber. Examine if the
inlet system is blocked. Examine that the fuel supply has
not been blocked by a defective fuel hose, tank vent or
the pulse hose.
Gasoline with a too low octane grade can cause ignition
at the incorrect position. Spark plugs with incorrect heat
rated value can cause the same problem. They can
increase the temperature in the combustion chamber.
Make sure that the key on the flywheel of the crankshaft
is not damaged. The flywheel position on the crankshaft
controls the ignition point.

73,Dust,"6.16.3.2 With a regular press
1.
Use a pipe as support. Minimum inner diameter:
34mm. Maximum outer diameter: 56mm
2.
Use a mandrel with a diameter of 22 – 23.5mm.
3.
With the press, push the 2 bearings into position.
4.
Before you put the seal, apply grease on top of the
bearing. See Servicing tools overview on page 14.
5.
Make sure that the seal is level before you press it
into position.
